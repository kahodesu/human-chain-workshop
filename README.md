# human-chain-workshop

This is a workshop I taught at the Incubate Arcade 2016 in Tilburg, NL. 
It is a workshop for adults, with varying skill levels and backgrounds, 
designed to be an introductory look into building physical games with technology. 

Included are: 
* Arduino code for Miniature Tag example game
* Processing code for Miniature Tag example game
* slides from workshop lecture
* diagram for building circuit board

###Schedule Notes: 
1.5 hours. 

####10 mins Intro
participant intros and what kind of work I do
* Name
* Where you are from
* Why were you interested in this workshop?

* how to download and get started
* why open source tools are important
    * accessibility - free
    * community
    * giving back

####10 mins Concepts
I don’t usually work with circuits before making project
So let’s explore some concepts behind a project first

####It’s about the people — human centered vs. tech centered experiences
Think about scenarios how holding hands or contact is important
* Red Rover
* Human chain saving dog
* Holding hands date challenge
* Kids poking each other

####The role of tech for playful interactive experiences
Tech as Judge as example

####Hiding Tech
Magic when tech is hidden

####20 mins the circuit
Setting up the game
Templates

####20 mins the code
downloading code
running the code
go over quickly what the code means

####20 mins brainstorming/playtesting
